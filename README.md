# E-Learning Platform with Progress Tracking

## Overview

The **E-Learning Platform with Progress Tracking** is a web-based application designed to provide users with an interactive learning experience. The platform allows users to enroll in courses, track their progress, and receive feedback through quizzes. Admins can manage courses and user data through an intuitive dashboard. This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, integrating front-end and back-end technologies.

## Setup Instructions

### Front-End

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Back-End

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (if not already created):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## API Endpoints

- **Courses**:
  - `GET /api/courses/` - List all courses
  - `POST /api/courses/` - Create a new course
  - `GET /api/courses/{id}/` - Retrieve a specific course
